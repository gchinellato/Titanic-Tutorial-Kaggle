## This Notebook will show basic examples of:

### Data Handling
- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data
- Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Data Analysis
- Feature engineering
- Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	- Random Forest Classifier
	- kNN
	- Decision Tree
	- Logistic Regression
	- Naive Bayes

### Valuation of the Analysis
 - K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
 - Fine-tuning using Grid Search
 - Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
